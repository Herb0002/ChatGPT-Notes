A simple but handy browser extension for ChatGPT that lets you **take notes directly inside the chat interface**.  
Notes can optionally be linked to specific chats, so you can keep track of your thoughts, TODOs, or ideas right where they came up.  

⚠️ **Important:** For the note content to be recognized correctly, it must be inside a **code block** (also called *raw paste*).  

---

## ✨ Features  
- 📝 **Work Notes Panel**: Extra panel inside ChatGPT to capture notes.  
- 🔗 **Chat Linking**: Attach notes to a specific chat for better context.  
- 🏷️ **Tags**: Categorize your notes with tags like `TODO`, `Problem`, `Bug`, `Info`, `Idea`, `Question`.  
- 💾 **Persistent Storage**: Notes are stored locally and survive page reloads.  
- 🔓 **Open Source**: Free to use, extend, and customize.
